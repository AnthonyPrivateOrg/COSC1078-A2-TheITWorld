								<h3>Scope and Limit</h3>
								<p>The scope of our project that we planned out was to make a prototype of a booking application, using a program such as Figma, to give us the basis of our project idea. This app will only follow a main key path scenario to demonstrate typical usage of the main functions. As a group, we then proposed to have a miniature of a carpark filled with sensory technology, perhaps using Arduino programming and components, to demonstrate how it will function and be presented. In the miniature and application, we will have at least three spots to display different typical key path scenarios that a user may do when using our system. These two main ideas were set out as they would best convey how a system such as this would reduce the struggles of finding a carpark bay.</p>
								
								
								<p>Furthermore, if time permits, we will try to expand the reach of our scope for the project. This will be accomplished by implementing a second layer to our sensory system by introducing an automatic bollard system. This will included in addition to the current system to further convey the effectiveness of our project idea. Despite, the app not being fully functional or connected to the Arduino system, we will try to demonstrate how they would operate in tandem with one another through the key path scenarios we have set</p>
								
					
								<p> Within the given time constraints, we will not be able to create a full functioning app that can connect to our sensory system since our project idea is a parking app which allows users to book/pay for a parking spot in advance. As we lack in the resources, such as materials, money, and time, to implement our idea into a real carpark area, we have chosen to display it in a miniature that will demonstrate the similar functions we desire. Using Arduino components in our miniature such LED lights and photoresistors, our system will be able to identify and indicate to the user whether a car spot is vacant/not booked or not vacant/booked. </p>
								
				
								
								<p>Due to limitations in our skills and resources of the technology portion of our project, functions such as the automatic bollard system and the connection between the Arduino sensory system and Figma application will not be fully functional at this time. Time restrictions also factor into this as well. However, if we did have more time, these implementations could have been made to a greater extent.</p>
								
								
								<p>Likewise, implementing our project into a more realistic scenario will require further research into the depths of how the construction of the carpark will work and if the area that we are implementing our technology would be suitable as most previous made parking areas might have other infrastructure or systems around such as sewerage lines, water mains or underground areas. Hence, a vast number of resources would need to be invested into our project to ensure that every possible angle in the development, potential problems and implementation is accounted for. p>
								
								
								
								<p>Consequently, limitations of time may be also impact our miniature model and Arduino system as the design may not be fully optimised to work in harmony with the Arduino system.</p>
