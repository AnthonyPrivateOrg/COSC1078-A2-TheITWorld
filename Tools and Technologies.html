								<h3>Artefact 1: Mobile Booking Application:</h3>
								<p>
									One of the technologies used to produce our mobile app 
									prototype is Figma, an online prototyping tool for 
									applications. We had considered using Proto.io, however, 
									compared to Figma, Proto.io required the purchase of a 
									premium membership to bring out its full potential. As 
									such, we had decided to use Figma to develop our mobile app 
									prototype, as it was free and because most of our members had 
									some experience using it.
								</p>

								<p>
									In terms of experience using Figma, both Anthony and Victor 
									(the ones developing the prototype) have little to no experience 
									using Figma. Anthony had never used Figma before, so he had to 
									take the time to learn how to use the tool quickly before 
									moving to developing the actual prototype. Victor, on the 
									other hand, had some prior experience using Figma, but still 
									wanted to take some time to brush up on his knowledge of the 
									tool. The other members of the team also have some experience 
									using the tool, however won’t be required to brush up on their 
									knowledge as they won’t be working on the development of the Figma 
									prototype.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Artefact 2.1: Arduino Sensory:</h3>
								<p>
									To create the overall artefact, the Arduino IDE 1.8.15 is required
									in order to program the Arduino board specifically the Arduino Uno board.
									A knowledge of the programming language C++ is used to do the programming required.
									Not only must there be an understanding in C++ but also understand the various functions 
									that can be used specifically in Arduino to control different parts. 4 LEDs were used in 
									this system (2 green and 2 red), a light dependent resistor, a multitude of wires of 
									different lengths and sizes, 5 220Ω resistors and a servo motor. Specifically for the LEDs,
									solder and a soldering iron were used to attach wires to the LEDs to extend their length.
									All of these parts were connected on to a breadboard which will allow more space for all the different parts. 
								</p>

								<p>
									George has had experience with using Arduino technology as in years 
									11 and 12 in high school he used an Arduino and has gained experienced 
									by completing school projects in his systems engineering class back then. 
									Victor also has basic knowledge using an Arduino however it has been years 
									since he has used one. Sahil also has a good understanding on using an 
									Arduino similar to George’s situation. George will however be creating 
									the electronics part of the project.

								<h3>Artefact 2.2: Parking Complex Miniature:</h3>
								<p>
									Furthermore, the miniature to house all the components of the Arduino 
									was conceptualised, designed and developed by Victor. The miniature was 
									created to demonstrate how the proposed system could potentially be 
									implemented in a real parking lot. The idea for the design stemmed from 
									reference images of other carpark models but was mostly based on what 
									the groups proposed scope was.

								<p>
									Hence, to meet the proposed scope we had set, it was decided to create 
									the model with three parking spots. This was due to the fact that the 
									application created on Figma was non-functional but displayed a main key 
									path scenario of typical usage of the app and its main functions. At 
									this point, the scope of the group had also included the implementation 
									of a bollard system. This would further demonstrate the effectiveness 
									of our proposed system and its reliability. The bollard system works 
									using a servo motor to raise and retract the bollard once the vehicle 
									goes over the photoresistor, dropping the light level and sending 
									a signal to the Arduino program.
