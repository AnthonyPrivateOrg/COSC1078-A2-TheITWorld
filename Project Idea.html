								<p>
									As a society, we are constantly developing and growing in many ways. 
									Specifically, our population. With just over 6.680 million people 
									currently residing in Victoria alone, it is no wonder we are such 
									a busy city. Consequently, we face many problems but, one of the 
									most ongoing and ‘annoying’ for most people is parking! Yes, this 
									is a constant hassle, whether it be for a quick trip to pick up 
									groceries or a needed spot to go to university, it is truly a 
									prominent problem that most drivers face. With this in mind, 
									they’re have been ways to counteract this such as increased parking 
									lot sizes or parking time restrictions to limit how long drivers 
									stay there. However, one such way around all of this would be an 
									app that would be able to let you know where parking is available 
									and even the ability to book it!  
								</p>

								<p>
									The inspiration for such an idea was drawn from the fact that our 
									phone is such a powerful tool and provides a plethora of resources 
									at the touch of a few buttons. Especially after the COVID-19 situation, 
									many services, such as food, entertainment, and retail, became more 
									reliant on booking systems as this method is effective and 
									efficient regarding customer wants and needs Now there are apps 
									present that have such functions, but none have truly accomplished 
									this as most can agree. For example, whenever you enter a large 
									shopping complex and try to find parking, you will notice the overhead 
									indicator sensors well indicate whether a parking spot is free. For 
									some reason though, you get there and to your surprise, there is a 
									vehicle parked in there! It can be frustrating and hence, having 
									the ability to have an app that can indicate truly whether a parking 
									spot is free or not will be revolutionary as it reduces the opportunity 
									for road rage, congestion in parking lots and most of all, provides a 
									fast and efficient service for users. This is because the improved 
									system will mean that drivers will be more organised when it comes 
									to their travel plans as they now possess, at their convenience, the 
									ability to observe and make bookings for a parking system. As such, 
									the stress factors of finding parking for motorists, law enforcers and 
									councils are alleviated due to more parking spots being readily 
									available for users. 
								</p>

								<p>
									The design of this app will have the purpose in mind to reduce the 
									problematic impact of the current parking situation. The application 
									will have the ability to indicate parking lots nearby that have 
									parking spaces available. Accomplishing this will require the user to 
									indicate whereabouts they are located as the app will be able to 
									allocate the nearest parking to your destination. This system will 
									then need to be linked to the already vehicle detection sensors that 
									are present in most shopping complexes. As discussed, the overhead 
									sensors present issues with indicating whether a vehicle is truly 
									parked or not. So, to overcome this, the addition of two implementations 
									can be made. The first being the booking system. This may be done 
									through the app and will indicate what spots are available on which 
									levels. To compliment this, it would be recommended for the use of 
									in-ground parking sensors as from experience, these provide a more 
									accurate reading. The in-ground sensors being reliable as well, also 
									have the function to alert parking officers that vehicles have illegally 
									parked in a booked spot or overstayed their booked duration.
								</p>

								<p>
									The app would then be able to display that which spots can be booked 
									for parking and the user will then be able to have the ability to book 
									using the app if they wish to guarantee the user that spot. As most 
									users are used to online purchasing, this will be a similar process 
									and allow the user to input such details and the spot will be reserved. 
									Furthermore, if the parking area has set rules, such as parking time 
									limits or payment to use parking, the system online will be able to 
									provide these details and inform users if a pre-payment needs to be 
									made to secure your spot. To indicate whether a spot is reserved or 
									not, the use of the overhead sensors may display a red light indicating 
									the spot has been reserved. Now depending on the budget of this project, 
									problems may arise. For instance, having a spot indicate whether it’s 
									been booked or not is well and all, but some people may still decide 
									to park. This can be frustrating as the system does rely on cooperation 
									from drivers. The alternate solutions, which require more funding, 
									but will ultimately ensure this is not a problem would be to have an 
									employee place a bollard/barricade in the spot once it has booked. The 
									user can then alert the attendee that they have arrived for their parking 
									and this can be removed. Alternatively, to reduce the manual labour 
									needed, having an in-ground retractable bollard in the centre or front 
									of the parking can extend once the booking has been made. Again, once 
									a driver has arrived, they simply need to use their app to send an alert 
									that they have arrived for the bollard to retract.

								</span>

								<p>
									Similarly, another big issue to ensure this app is successful will be 
									the implementation of the sensory technology. It will be a big cost 
									but will be worth the while as it ensures drivers can now have a 
									secured spot instead of the mad scramble most of us experience. On 
									the other hand, even though this system would be implemented into 
									parking located in shopping centres, congested areas, and more, it 
									may be unrealistic and unwise to have every parking complex have 
									this sensory system in place as it requires more funding for the 
									setting up, managing and maintenance of the systems. To overcome 
									this, the parking ticket machines that are present in most parking 
									areas can have a similar system be implemented and be used to select 
									a parking spot. A driver would be then able to go to the designated 
									parking spot they choose. This information can then be relayed to 
									the app and it can indicate which parking lots have parking available. 
									In totality, this will also eliminate the problem for those drivers 
									who do not want to book and would rather just turn up to the centre 
									and hope for a parking spot available.  
								</p>

								<p>
									And like any application, the project will need to go through several 
									phases of testing. This will need to be done in both the 
									website/application and the technology. The testing for the 
									website/application will be to ensure that the system is easy for users 
									to navigate and use and for their experience of booking to not be 
									limited by the website. The link between the sensory system and the 
									booking system will then be tested once established. This may include 
									making sure the website is not static and provide live updates for 
									each parking lot. By having the app update the status of a parking 
									spot as a user is booking/has booked, this will reduce the confusion 
									when it comes to using the website/application. As mentioned previously, 
									it will require a huge effort to get this project underway but a 
									recommendation for the testing process could be simply a singular parking 
									spot with all the sensory set up for it or a miniature version of it. 
									This will verify and solidify the feasibility of the project. Both the 
									parking spot and miniature would need to make certain of the following 
									points: 
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>
										Whether the booking app/website functions as intended – the user 
										will be informed of the available spots, what the conditions to 
										book the spots, details of the parking shop and more and hence, 
										they would be able to book/pay for the spot (if required) and will 
										display as being booked or booked to other users
									</li>
									<li>
										The booking system is linked to sensory system properly – this 
										will be indicated by whether the bollard or barricade has been 
										put in place once a booking has occurred. 
									</li>
									<li>
										The sensory system and its reliability – making certain that 
										the in-ground sensors detect different vehicles and that this 
										will also update the overhead sensors to display to users that 
										the spot is in use/been booked. 
									</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									or this idea to launch, it will require the use of the app to be 
									created and have such functions as mentioned previously. This app 
									can be available across all devices, being tablet, phone, and 
									computer friendly. Likewise, the system may also be on a website 
									as well for more casual users and ensures the system appeals to 
									both casual and regular parking bookers. The other piece of hardware 
									needed, which is dependent on budget, would be the installation of 
									the in-ground sensors for the parking and the method to stop those 
									parking in reserved spots; either a manual process of an attendee 
									employed for such or an in-ground retractable bollard. Furthermore, 
									the app would then need to have access and linked to the parking 
									companies’ systems and sensory technology within as this will allow 
									for the communication and relay of information of whether parking is 
									available, the ability to see whether a user can book or not, and 
									more. It’s not a far stretch but certainly does require a lot of 
									cooperation between the parking companies and the developer of the 
									app/website. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Consequently, this will be a demanding project and having great 
									time management, persistence and a solution-oriented mindset is 
									the best approach to undertake such a project. To hit the ground 
									running with this project, being able to use a mobile app 
									development software and website creation is necessary. Having 
									experience and skills in software’s such as Appy Pie or BuildFire 
									will allow the project to be carried out smoothly as the parking 
									system requires minimal coding ability to create the beginnings of 
									a well thought out application. Despite these ‘requirements’, 
									such skills and software are in reasonable reach as they are skills 
									we develop in everyday life and work. The workflow would be most 
									impeded by the need for access to parking databases and information 
									as this will need to be negotiated. However, after the details 
									have been sorted, the app/website booking system would need to link 
									to the sensors.  
								</p>

								<p>
									All in all, developing a parking app will surely ease the current 
									problem of finding parking and the congestion it creates in a fair 
									and equitable manner. Parties such as motorists, law enforcers, 
									councils and management teams will all be impacted in a pleasant 
									way as it reduces the burdens parking creates for them. The apps 
									interface and functions will allow for a smoother process of finding 
									a parking that is suitable and available for all drivers, rather 
									than hoping for the best. The use of essentially a booking system 
									and parking indicator system will allow for a more relax environment 
									when it comes to parking. This in turn will reduce the road rage 
									and competition for a parking spot and instead, make this process 
									an efficient and civil viability for those who choose to use this 
									app/website.
