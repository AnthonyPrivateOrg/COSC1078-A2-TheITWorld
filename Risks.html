								<h3>Risks</h3>
								<p>Some of the risks that can occur in our project included the Arduino running into hardware problems. This could consist of not connecting to the LDR or LED lights correctly due to faulty components. Further issues regarding the hardware could possibly be the LDR not registering the correct light levels. This adversity could be overcome by testing however, and making sure that every different model of car can be detected, and that the information can be sent to the app. For example, if a Jeep was to park into the parking spot compared to a hatchback car, they both would need to be able to detect as they are both different shapes and sizes.</p>
								<p>Problems that could have arisen if the application were to be fully developed, would revolve around software issues or privacy leaks. The app could also run into security issues such as hackers, trying to access personal information. The prototype that we have developed is non-functional meaning the implementation into a realistic scenario would not be possible at this stage</p>
							  	<p>Furthermore, the development of the app might run into some security issues such as cyber-attacks. Since our app requires payment made through a person’s debit or credit card, their information will be exposed. So, it will be up to us to make sure that our information is secured and the privacy of others. Not only that the servers that we have for the app could also run into problems such as overheating. Since servers require a lot of resources to maintain, we need to make sure that we are able to do that. We will also need to make sure that the server is in secure location so no one can access it.</p>
								<p>A potential risk that may arise due to the communication between the software and hardware could be the automatic bollard system not properly functioning. This could lead to the bollard system not being responsive and in the worst-case scenario, the bollard will raise while a user is parking or has parked. However, to reduce the impact of this issue, Pie9 has implemented two features to counteract it. The first being the placement of the bollard. We have ensured the bollard is located just in front of the parking spot, as this means little to no damage will be done to the vehicle if the bollard were to raise up. Furthermore, the in-ground sensor would be another support to reduce the chances of such an event as the sensor will be communicating to the system that there is a vehicle parked, and in such case, the bollard will respond by not changing the current status of ‘retracted’.</p>
								<p>Pie9 has also considered risks that could occur in the future. Regarding the placement of our system, we would need to research and analyse the areas our system would be implemented in. This would be due to the system we are using as it would require in-ground bollards installed. Areas that have water mains, pipe-heavy areas, sewerage lines and more would need to be risky areas to be developing in and hence, making sure that these precautions are taken would guarantee our success in introducing our system to a realistic environment.</p>
								<p>Likewise, ensuring the technology we use for a realistic environment would need to be tested as factors such as the system not responding, light levels being misread, communication between the software and hardware could potentially lead to risks for our user. If the system is not responsive or does not communicate well, the user’s vehicle is put at risk due to damage from the bollard system.</p>
