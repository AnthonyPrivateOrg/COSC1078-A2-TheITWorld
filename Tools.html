								<h3>Tools and Communication:</h3>
								<p>
									Our group has set up a MS Teams team, which we use to 
									communicate outside of tutorials and to hold our weekly 
									meetings, this is as per the specifications of this assignment. 
									The weekly meetings focus on keeping all members up-to-date 
									on what the others are doing, if they need help or if 
									they’re going fine. The first meeting, was used to set 
									up and assign work, while the last few meetings will be 
									about finalising the assignment and writing up the group 
									reflection. As one of the two of our weekly meetings is in the 
									face-to-face class, only one recording is made each week, which 
									is on every Wednesday at 8:30pm.
								</p>
								<p>
									The team has also decided to use two different locations to 
									share files, in terms of report content documents, which were MS 
									Teams Files and GitHub. Although the team initially thought of 
									using Google Drive to store files, we ended up not using it as 
									MS Teams Files had provided the same functionality as Google Drive, 
									or at least the same functionality that we needed. The reason 
									for using multiple locations was simply for backup and to give 
									each member different ways of sharing files. GitHub was mainly 
									used to share code, although the templates were made by Victor, 
									as we were using his assignment 1 template, the rest of the team 
									would need access to the templates to create their own pages. 
								</p>
								<p>
									In terms of git commits and lines committed, this wouldn’t truly 
									reflect the workload distributed. In terms of number of commits, 
									it is possible that they would reflect workload, as each member 
									should have uploaded their documents for their assigned sections. 
									However, in terms of the website code, as we are using a template 
									from someone’s assignment 1 with some changes, the code lines 
									committed will be heavily skewed towards the person who uploaded 
									the code. In this case Victor would have the most lines committed, 
									as we were using his template for the website. The group had 
									decided this, with permission of Victor, as this would make 
									creating the website faster and easier. It was also agreed upon, 
									as each member was working on the content side and would only need 
									to copy their content onto the html pages.
								</p>

									Below are the related links for the teams GitHub repository, 
									GitHub Pages website, Teams Join Link, and the Teams Link.
