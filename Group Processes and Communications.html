									Communication for any project is a key element in successful completion as in most cases, it can be the deciding factor that helps to determine the outcome of your project. Pie9 has made it a priority to communicate with other members on a regular basis. This has been agreed upon for various reasons such as ensuring that everyone is up to date, any changes (major or minor) required to be made have been agreed upon before done, to help others when a member is struggling or is need of assistance and many more valuable reasons.
								</p>
								<p>
									As a team, we have communicated mainly through the platform Microsoft Teams. Not only it is a required platform, but it helps to keep everyone on top of tasks as we are able to freely discuss topics, such as the ones bought up during meetings, set deadlines, share work through the ‘Files’ tab and gather feedback from each other. We have found that this to be a successful means of communication and have further used it to directly message one another when needed.
								</p>
								<p>
									To support everyone’s scheduling, the group has agreed upon 2 meeting times that each member must be in attendance of. Generally, we try to ensure this meeting is non-negotiable in regards of missing it however, we understand that there are lot of unexpected factors in the mix and consequently, each member is responsible to catch up (either by watching the recording or through talking to the team) as we all need to stay up to date. Furthermore, as this meeting is held on Microsoft Teams (around 8:30 PM on every Wednesday), we make necessary adjustments needed for members who may be running behind schedule.
								</p>
								<p>
									Additionally, the second meeting we hold is in person in our face-to-face practical class for this unit. We find the time provided by the tutor is more than sufficient when needing to communicate and can include the teacher in the discussion if needed. It is also a great way to build the team relationship to ensure we are working together efficiently and effectively.
								</p>
								<p>
									Pie9’s adaptability is exceptional as exemplified by the group’s reaction to the current situations. For example, each member’s immediate reaction is to support another member if they are struggling and if necessary, we will arrange more meetings throughout the week to aid one another. As the communication, in totality, is great amongst members, we still make certain to stay ‘on top’ of one another and by doing so, members do not lack behind. However, if a member for some reason does not respond, the team always has a backup (whether it is a draft of the person’s work, a group member taking over that section, contacting the member via other media such as Discord, Messenger, etc) and simply put, the members know we cannot afford to lose time. Hence, each member takes it upon themselves to let others know if they cannot be in attendance for a meeting or cannot handle a section for any reasons and subsequently, we are able to adjust to accommodate this change.
