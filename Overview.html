								<h3>Topic</h3>
								<p>
									As a society, we are constantly developing and growing in 
									many ways. Specifically, our population. With just over 6.680 
									million people currently residing in Victoria alone, it is no 
									wonder we are such a busy city. Consequently, we face many 
									problems but, one of the most ongoing and ‘annoying’ for most 
									people is parking! Yes, this is a constant hassle, whether it 
									be for a quick trip to pick up groceries or a needed spot 
									to go to university, it is truly a prominent problem that most 
									drivers face. Hence, Pie9 has analysed and researched into 
									possible solutions to counteract this situation.
								</p>
								<p>
									From what has been collated, Pie9 has deemed that the 
									development of a parking application that enables a user to 
									book a spot at a desired parking lot will yield the best possible 
									outcome to this problem we face.
								</p>

								</span>
								<p>
									In this project, Pie9 has proposed to develop a prototype application 
									that will allow the user to select a parking lot, search for parking 
									spot availability at this spot and book a spot if desired. The application 
									will then be able to then send a signal to the indicated parking lot and 
									with the support of in-ground and overhead sensors, the spot will be 
									booked for the customer. The status of the booking system will be displayed 
									by the application but also by the system in the parking complex. In 
									comparison to other systems, Pie9 has proposed to implement not only 
									the overhead and in-ground sensors but also, the use of in-ground retractable 
									bollards. These bollards will not only function as an indicator but as a 
									safety net to ensure unbooked users do not take another user’s spot. Once 
									arrived at the spot, the user can then signal through the application that 
									they have arrived, triggering the bollard to retract back. Further to that, 
									some parking complexes require payment for parking. Like most applications, 
									the user will be able to make payment by entering in payment details to do so 
									on the users account. This will help to eliminate the mad scramble we all face 
									when trying to find a parking spot at the shopping centres or at events. 
								</p>
								<p>
									To demonstrate this, Pie9 will also develop a miniature of a parking spot 
									that will display how the parking application will function and how the 
									technology that will be required will function and interact with this system. 
									The miniature will use a simple Arduino breadboard, LDR/photoresistor and 
									LED lights to show a mock-up version of the technology that would be required 
									for our project on a larger scale. The miniature will be designed to 
									represent a slice of a parking lot with the LDR embedded in the ground (acting 
									as the in-ground sensor technology) and the LED will be mounted above 
									(acting as the overhead sensor technology) and both will work in conjunction 
									to show when a spot has been booked and consequently, when it is not vacant. 
									The use of painted wooden sticks with a ‘push and pull’ tag attached will 
									imitate the function of retractable in-ground bollards to demonstrate the 
									level of control this system desires.
								</p>
								<p>
									In conjunction with each other, we will demonstrate the complete system by a 
									user using the application, designed, and developed in Figma, to request 
									to make a booking at a parking lot by inputting the details needed, such 
									as location, level of parking, type of parking spot required (disabled 
									parking, pram parking, etc), payment details (if required) and more. This 
									information will then be relayed to the parking complex and the spot that 
									was selected will now be booked as indicated by the overhead sensors (green 
									LED now turning red). In addition, to demonstrate the function of the 
									in-ground sensors, Pie9 will also show a situation of a car spot being already 
									occupied/booked and not occupied/not booked and how it will impact the 
									application and the overhead sensors and retractable bollards. Overall, 
									this application and miniature will validate the proposed venture of our 
									project and how it will help to improve the current parking situation.
								</p>
								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>
									The inspiration for such an idea was drawn from the fact that our 
									phone is such a powerful tool and provides a plethora of resources 
									at the touch of a few buttons. Especially after the COVID-19 situation, 
									many services, such as food, entertainment, and retail, became more 
									reliant on booking systems as this method is effective and efficient 
									regarding customer wants and needs Now there are other parking apps 
									present that have such functions, but none have truly accomplished a 
									booking system for parking that is reliant and diverse as most can 
									agree. For example, whenever you enter a large shopping complex and 
									try to find parking, you will notice the overhead indicator sensors 
									well indicate whether a parking spot is free. For some reason though, 
									you get there and to your surprise, there is a vehicle parked in there! 
									It can be frustrating and hence, having the ability to have an app in 
									conjunction with an overhead and in-ground sensor, that can indicate 
									reliably whether a parking spot is vacant or not will be revolutionary 
									as it reduces the opportunity for road rage, congestion in parking lots 
									and most of all, provides a fast and efficient service for users. This 
									is due to the fact that the improved system will mean that drivers will 
									be more organised when it comes to their travel plans as they now possess, 
									at their convenience, the ability to observe and make bookings for a 
									parking system. As such, the stress factors of finding parking for 
									motorists, law enforcers and councils are alleviated due to more parking 
									spots being readily available for users.

								</span>
								<p>
									The system is most important for the integration of benefits it will 
									have on daily life. With technology constantly developing at a rapid 
									rate, the future generations are always striving to develop new and 
									innovative ways to make life easier. This booking system is no exception 
									as it makes a common struggle become effortless through the means 
									of organisation and awareness. Having the ability to do such at a push 
									f a few buttons is a common demand for the current IT world as it 
									provides what all IT advancements desire to do, to be an effective and 
									efficient system while retaining convenience and ease of use for the users. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Furthermore, this project will demonstrate to any employer the time 
									management, innovation, analysis skills and solution-oriented mindset 
									that is needed to prosper in the IT industry. Possessing the sheer 
									determination to keep on pressing onwards is what any employers desire 
									in their employees as they are able to get to the job done reliably in 
									a creative manner. Needless to say, this is a crucial trait to ensure 
									you are successful in your position.

								</span>
								<p>
									During the creation of the application and miniature, Pie9 first observed 
									and analysed similar products/services that were available to the users. 
									Subsequently, we found that companies such as Parkalot, Secure Parking 
									and Wilson Parking are the competitors in this field offering a similar 
									service of car park booking. With the Secure Parking and Wilson Parking 
									(both very large companies in the parking industry), these companies seek 
									to reduce the congestion that parking can create. Since these companies 
									are spread all over, this will greatly improve the use of their car parks 
									by enticing users to an ease to use parking spot. 
								</p>
								<span class="image right">

									<i>Figure 4: Wilson Parking, photograph, viewed 19 May 2021, &lt;https://www.wilsonparking.com.au/find-a-park&gt;</i>
								</span>
								<p>
									While the Secure Parking and Wilson Parking are established 
									companies/parking complexes, the Parkalot application allows individuals 
									or corporations to create their own parking management system. This is 
									accomplished by allowing the manager to assign spots to the intended users 
									and hence, establish their own personal parking spot that they are allowed 
									to park in. From this, the user can use the Parkalot app to book for their 
									parking. Unlike the approach of the Wilson and Secure Parking applications, 
									the parking complex is not apart of a parking branch and evidently, 
									this system allows the user to create a more tailored service that will 
									essentially be done at the user’s discretion.
								</p>

								</span>
								<p>
									Compared to the mentioned applications, Pie9 is proposing a booking 
									system but it will be in conjunction with the overhead and in-ground 
									sensors to achieve more reliable ‘security’ when booking a spot. This 
									application will also be aimed towards shopping centres, university campuses, 
									local malls, event heavy areas and other non-established parking complexes 
									as they will benefit from our system the most. By having the use of a 
									booking system, this provides an initial enforcement on reduced parking 
									time and frustration for users. The implementations of the sensors and the 
									bollards is the second layer of reinforcement to ensure the first system 
									is not compromised by potential people who may not use the booking system 
									and consequently, guarantee the spots booked stay vacant for those patrons.
