  <li>Portable Phone Charging Dock </li>
  <li>Platform Game </li>
  <li>Parking Application/System </li>
  <li>Hydration Level of Soil </li>
  <li>Cloud Computer </li>
</ul>  
    
Besides this, we discussed and brainstormed any other possible ideas. With not much luck deciding, we proposed that we would have a think and by next week, have a decided project idea as a group.

    <td>The following week, we had our in-class session and had time to discuss and reason why we had chosen our respective project ideas. From this discussion, we managed to narrow it down to the platforming game and parking application. This was due to the fact that both these systems possessed the most potential to develop a feasible artefact from A3, which is what was required. 

At the end of the discussion, we were all in agreeance to have the parking application/system that Victor had proposed in his A1 submission. We then set a goal to think about what would be the artefacts we would develop for the A3 submission. </td>

    <td>After meeting back, we went around the table and discussed what options would be able available to us as we had many limitations with the greatest being time. From what we discussed, we had set our goal to create an application but felt that this would not be enough to do well in this submission as it was a step up from our last submission. That is when we decided to create a miniature version of a parking lot. George had mentioned that he had experience with Arduino programming and was happy to implement a sensory system that would demonstrate the functionality of our proposed system. </td>

After having our project idea decided and the feasible artefacts that we endeavoured to present for our A3 submission, we needed to read through the assignment brief individually to ensure all of us understood what was expected and required for this assignment. Each member did so and during our meeting, we needed to assign sections to each member. After much deliberation and debate, we were all given our sections that we were happy with and was as follows: 
    
<ul>
  <li>Document Formatting – Victor </li>
  <li>Team Profile – George </li>
  <li>Tools – Anthony </li>
  <li>Overview – Victor </li>
  <li>Aims – George </li>
  <li>Plans and Progress – Artem </li>
  <li>Roles – Artem </li>
  <li>Scope and Limits – Sahil </li>
  <li>Tools and Technologies - Victor/Anthony/George </li>
  <li>Testing - Sahil </li>
  <li>Timeframe - Everyone/Artem 	</li>
  <li>Weeks 7-9 – Artem </li>
  <li>Weeks 10-12 – Individual </li>
  <li>10 Weeks after – Artem </li>
  <li>Risks – Sahil </li>
  <li>Group Processes and Communications – Victor </li>
  <li>Skills and Jobs - Artem/Victor/Anthony/Sahil </li>
  <li>Marketing Manager/Director – Victor </li>
  <li>Software Developer – Sahil </li>
  <li>UX Designer – Anthony </li>
  <li>Engineer – Artem </li>
  <li>Group Reflection – Anthony </li>
  <li>Prototype (model) - George/Victor </li>
  <li>Prototype (model) - George/Victor </li>
  <li>Meeting Documentation - Anthony 

 </li>
</ul>      
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
<p>In addition, Anthony and Victor were tasked to work on the first artefact: the booking application, while George and Victor were to work on the second artefact: the miniature and Arduino sensory system.</p>

 

<p>To ensure we were on track, the group agreed that each member was to have dot point notes of each section to show progress and the direction they were going to take with their section.</p>

<p>During this week, the group was well underway and was on task as all members had their dot point notes of their section, allowing for an easy start to their section, as well as the artefacts being discussed amongst Victor and Anthony and George and Victor. It was also in this week that we all decided that a draft version of each member’s section should be completed. Although a big task, this was to ensure the team was up to date and would not fall behind as the deadline for submission was fast approaching.</p> 

 

<p>While George had an initial design of the Arduino system made, Victor had researched and developed the starts of a miniature to house the Arduino. As it was done separately, at some point they would need to meet up to combine both systems together.</p> 

 

<p>Victor and Anthony also conversed, contemplating whether to use Figma or Proto.io for the application. It was later decided to go to Figma due to accessibility of it being a lot of suitable for our project idea.</p>

 

Furthermore, each member continued to work each of their sections to ensure they had a drafted version done. 
    
    
    
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Ensure each section is done, artefacts have been completed and ultimately, be ready for submission. </td>
    <td>
<p>As this was the final week for submission (initially at least), we ensured that we all had a drafted version of each section done. Although some members had not completed this yet, we ensured it was done soon after that meeting. </p>

 

<p>Victor and Anthony had also had a final version of the application made while Victor and George had the miniature and Arduino system set up together. Victor and George decided to had a few final touches to ensure the demonstration of the application and the system would best reflect our project idea.</p> 

 

<p>Unfortunately, one of our members had experienced a tragic event within their family life, and in response to that, the group had decided to reorganise the distribution of work to allow for our member to take some personal time off from the project. As such, we had discussed the possibility of an extension, and was granted an extra week (five days to be exact). Although the group was granted an extension, we had decided to still try and finish all the work roughly by the original due date, as to not drag out the work too long.</p> 

 

<p>As such, the following members undertook the sections to further develop and improve them:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>Plans and Progress – Anthony/George/Victor </li>
  <li>Timeframe – Victor </li>
  
</ul>

    <td>As we have been given an extension, use this time to finalise everyone’s section, improve the artefacts, report, and website. Also quality check and assist members with their work. </td>
    <td>
<p>Due to the extension, we used this week to finalise and did a quality check on the sections to ensure the report and website all flowed well. Victor and Anthony were mainly in charge of this.</p>

 

<p>As the report had now been finished, we decided to create a video of the miniature and application as this would better convey the project idea. This was done by George with the help of the group suggestions.</p>  

 

<p>Once done, the A3 submission was concluded by Wednesday the 01/06.</p> 

 </td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Theoretical Goal: Reflect on our A3 submission. Then outline and assign new tasks for the team members. </td>
    <td>
    
If more time was permitted, our initial thought was to reflect on our A3 submission. What could have been improved, what went well, was our time management acceptable and more. These questions would help to set the tone/pace of the next 9 weeks. Consequently, we would first need to decide our plan of attack to further our project. From what we have brainstormed and believe would be the most appropriate, the following tasks would need to be done: 
    
    <ul>
  <li>Reflect on our A3 submission. Then outline and assign new tasks for the team members </li>
  <li>Begin work on a functioning application </li>
  <li>Improvement to the miniature and it’s Arduino sensory system </li>
  <li>Begin to link the application and Arduino system together </li>
  <li>Test the new system and adjust accordingly to the feedback </li>
  <li>Begin to research more in developing this project in real life scenario and what would be required </li>
</ul>  
    
As these tasks are more involved and will require more time and skills, we would estimate a maximum of 2 weeks for some of these tasks to ensure they met with the same quality. This is to ensure all members can achieve a satisfactory level of understanding for any tools and technologies new to the group.  
    
    </td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Theoretical Goal: Begin work on a functioning application. </td>
    <td>Our first goal would be further work on the application. We would begin by researching into application development tools and what would best suit our needs. Development tools such as Appy Pie and Buddy on offer, these would allow for a smooth transition between our current application design/idea to our new one. We would continue to research to decide the best course of action. sq</td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>Theoretical Goal: Continuation of developing a functional application.</td>
    <td>Furthermore, once we have decided upon the application, we would then begin work on transferring the features of our previous application to this one and then further develop those. The system would need to be live and allow the user to input desired details such as card details, where they want to park, personal information and more. This more fleshed out version of the application would require a lot of development as it would need to connect to eventually connect to the parking lot system. </td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>Theoretical Goal: Improvement to the miniature and it’s Arduino sensory system. </td>
    <td>Likewise, the miniature would need to be revised and improved. The set up we have is limited by the number of spots we have but also the sensory system implemented. To improve this, we would need to research carpark complexes that have similar technology implemented to what works and what could we improve. </td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>Theoretical Goal: Further improvement to the miniature and it’s Arduino sensory system. </td>
    <td>Additionally, we would then be able to compose another miniature on a larger scale. In terms of the sensory system, the Arduino components work well to demonstrate the purpose, but we would need to make sure it can link to our application first or what components might be needed for it. Subsequently, the bollard system could be automated, and further refinement can be done to the sensory system by the implementation of a single light instead of a dual light that we have at the current time. </td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>Theoretical Goal: Begin to link the application and Arduino system together. </td>
    <td>After the completion of our artefacts, we would then need to link our application to the Arduino system. As this was not accomplished in this assignment, we will need to ensure we are all on task to get it done as it new for all of us. Likewise, we would then do further research in how the application would link to a database because ultimately, the bollard should not be directly controlled by the user but instead, have the application send a signal to a database is linked to the sensory system of the parking complex to then be approved first. 

 

<p>This will all be done to guarantee there are reduced problems with the system.</p> 

</td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>Theoretical Goal: Further develop the connection between the artefacts. </td>
    <td>If we are able to determine a method to establish this connection with the Arduino, we will then need to continue to refine the system and ensure the system is working in harmony. This is done to ensure the pitched project idea is met with finesse and the flaws present will be minimal. </td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>Theoretical Goal: Test the new system and adjust accordingly to the feedback. </td>
    <td>To ensure the system is now completed, we will be required to do testing of the everything. Not only will testing need to be done to ensure the system works well with the application and miniature but also, ensure the application has no faults in it. This may be done by having random users come in and use the application. 

 

<p>From the feedback gathered, the necessary adjustments can be made to the system to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and reliability.</p>

</td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>Theoretical Goal: Begin to research more in developing this project in real life scenario and what would be required.  </td>
    <td>In the final theoretical week, once all the testing and development is done, we will then need to begin research on implementing this into an actual carpark complex. This will be a huge step but in the right direction to take our project idea to the next stage. This will include numerous tasks such as marketing pitches, design modifications, talks to experts, talks to parking companies to implement our system in and more. It will take a team effort to push the idea to this stage, requiring persistence and determination.  </td>
