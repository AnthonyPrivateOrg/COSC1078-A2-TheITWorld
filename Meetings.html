								<h3>MS Teams and Face-to-Face Meetings:</h3>
								<p>
									Below are links to the specified meeting sections, 
									as well as any recording for meetings. Some of the 
									meetings were not recorded as they were conducted 
									face-to-face during the tutorial sessions. To access 
									the recordings, please ensure that you log in to an 
									RMIT email. The reason for this and not simply making 
									it public, is because making it public would expire at 
									the end of May. Meetings were conducted every week, 
									with one meeting being face-to-face and the other meeting 
									was conducted online via Microsoft Teams. Meetings conducted 
									online were recorded and linked under the ‘Recording’ link.

								<h3>30/03/2021 Meeting (Face-to-Face)</h3>
								<div id=agenda01>
									<h3>Agenda:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									This meeting was about ensuring that all members knew how and where to 
									contact each other, as well as deciding a rough time on when to have an 
									official meeting. As we also had an additional member (to the initial group), 
									we had to ensure that we added them to the MS Teams channel, and updated 
									them on what had happened during the meeting. Most members had assignments 
									from other courses, so it was decided that each member only think about 
									which project idea to use and read through the specifications before next 
									meeting. This meeting also has no recording, as with every odd recording as 
									the group decided that one out of the two group meetings would be held during 
									the tutorial class (face-to-face/on campus).
								</p>
								<p>
									The key agenda for this meeting was to discuss potential project ideas, 
									not necessarily the idea that would be used for assignment, but just to 
									consider potential ideas and share them with the group. We had decided to 
									hold off on distributing work because one member was missing, however, we 
									briefly went over how we think the work should be distributed, and roughly 
									how many people should work on each section.
								</p>
								<div id=actions01>
									<h3>Actions:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									Members were to choose a project idea that the group would go through with, 
									and also read through the specifications of the assignment and think about 
									how the work could be split. As this meeting was before the mid-semester 
									break, there was not much work assigned. They would need to be prepared 
									to meet at the designated date to meet and discuss the assignment more 
									thoroughly with all members present.
								</p>
								<div id=agenda02>
									<h3>Agenda:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									This meeting was actually pushed forward, as the planned time was actually 
									the 7th of April, however, going forward all online meetings would be on 
									Wednesdays at 8:30pm. The agenda for this meeting was mainly to go through 
									the specifications and assign each member with a section or more each. 
									Another topic on the agenda was to discuss the project idea and to choose 
									one out of the ones suggested by the members.
								</p>
								<p>
									After going through the assignment specifications as a group, each member 
									was to express any section they wish to have or any section they didn’t 
									want to have. This was in hopes of improve the quality of work, because 
									if members were assigned to a section they wanted they were more likely 
									to work harder on it. As no members expressed any desire, we simply 
									went through the list and Anthony, as the chair of the meetings, suggested 
									a random member. In the end the majority of the sections were only 
									assigned one person. The only sections split up to multiple people 
									where the industry data section and the IT technologies section. This was 
									because these two sections were considered to be larger than the others.
								</p>
								<p>
									Regarding the project idea, the group decided that the idea we would 
									proceed with was the parking spot booking app. This was because this 
									was the idea which was the most fleshed out, as it was Victor’s assignment 
									1 idea, and that the group already had an idea of how such an application 
									would function.
								</p>
								<p>
									The final topic on the agenda was to remind everyone about potential 
									deadlines and meeting dates for the future. It was decided that we 
									would be meeting twice a week, once during the tutorial and the second 
									during the online meetings on every Wednesday at 8:30pm.
								</p>
								<div id=actions02>
									<h3>Actions:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									As everyone has been assigned a section, each member would need to 
									start working on the content side of their sections (i.e. ignoring the 
									website for now). They will also need to send the emails they used to 
									Anthony, as he is setting up the GitHub repository. Each member would 
									also need to be ready to meet in the next tutorial, and ‘report’ on what 
									they’ve done, any issues they may have, and what they plan to do.
								</p>
								<p>
									The actions that need to be taken after the meeting was simply to work 
									on the assigned sections. As everyone had been assigned at least one 
									section, they would need to start working on the content side of the 
									section, and would need to make some considerable progress by next meeting. 
									They would need to post they’re documents into the MS Teams and the 
									GitHub to show that they have completed their assigned work.
								</p>
								<p>
									Each member would also need to send a message with the email they use 
									for their GitHub account so that Anthony could add them to the group 
									repository. Each member would need to be ready to “report” on what 
									they’ve done, any issues they had when working on their section, 
									and what they plan to do after the meeting.
