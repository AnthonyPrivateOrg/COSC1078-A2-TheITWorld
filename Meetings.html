									face-to-face during the tutorial sessions. To access 
									the recordings, please ensure that you log in to an 
									RMIT email. The reason for this and not simply making 
									it public, is because making it public would expire at 
									the end of May. Meetings were conducted every week, 
									with one meeting being face-to-face and the other meeting 
									was conducted online via Microsoft Teams. Meetings conducted 
									online were recorded and linked under the ‘Recording’ link.

								<h3>30/03/2021 Meeting (Face-to-Face)</h3>
								<div id=agenda01>
									<h3>Agenda:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									This meeting was about ensuring that all members knew how and where to 
									contact each other, as well as deciding a rough time on when to have an 
									official meeting. As we also had an additional member (to the initial group), 
									we had to ensure that we added them to the MS Teams channel, and updated 
									them on what had happened during the meeting. Most members had assignments 
									from other courses, so it was decided that each member only think about 
									which project idea to use and read through the specifications before next 
									meeting. This meeting also has no recording, as with every odd recording as 
									the group decided that one out of the two group meetings would be held during 
									the tutorial class (face-to-face/on campus).
								</p>
								<p>
									The key agenda for this meeting was to discuss potential project ideas, 
									not necessarily the idea that would be used for assignment, but just to 
									consider potential ideas and share them with the group. We had decided to 
									hold off on distributing work because one member was missing, however, we 
									briefly went over how we think the work should be distributed, and roughly 
									how many people should work on each section.
								</p>
								<div id=actions01>
									<h3>Actions:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									Members were to choose a project idea that the group would go through with, 
									and also read through the specifications of the assignment and think about 
									how the work could be split. As this meeting was before the mid-semester 
									break, there was not much work assigned. They would need to be prepared 
									to meet at the designated date to meet and discuss the assignment more 
									thoroughly with all members present.
