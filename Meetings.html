								<h3>MS Teams and Face-to-Face Meetings:</h3>
								<p>
									Below are links to the specified meeting sections, as well as any 
									recording for meetings. Some of the meetings were not recorded 
									as they were conducted face-to-face during the tutorial sessions. 
									To access the recordings, please ensure that you log in to an RMIT 
									email. The reason for this and not simply making it public, is 
									because making it public would expire at the end of May. Meetings 
									were conducted every week, with one meeting being face-to-face 
									and the other meeting was conducted online via Microsoft Teams. 
									Meetings conducted online were recorded and linked under the 
									‘Recording’ link.
								</p>
								<p>
									There were also other “meetings” conducted online, however, as 
									these meetings consisted of the group working on the assignment 
									together they were not recorded as they were both long and would 
									not provide much information to anyone external to the group 
									viewing it.

								<h3>11/05/2021 Meeting (Face-to-Face)</h3>
								<div id=agenda01>
									<h3>Agenda:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									This meeting was our first meeting after assignment 2, however, we had decided 
									not to assignment sections to members. The reasons for this is, we found it 
									would be more beneficial for each member to read through the assignment 
									specification in their own time and pick a few sections they wish to work on. 
									Although we didn’t assignment sections, we discussed what our assignment 
									artefacts would be, and decided that we would develop a mobile app prototype 
									with either Figma or Proto.io, as well as develop a miniature of the project 
									idea using an Arduino. The final topic on the agenda was to confirm that 
									everyone was still fine with the regular meeting times of Wednesday, as it 
									was important that we meet at least once online to discuss the assignment 
									and make sure everyone is on track.
								</p>
								<div id=actions01>
									<h3>Actions:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									Each member was tasked to read through the assignment specifications in 
									their own time and pick a few sections they wish to work on. If they 
									don’t do this, or are fine with working on any section, they will 
									automatically be assigned the leftover sections. Each member is 
									also to ensure that they can attend the Wednesday night meeting, 
									if not they are to inform the group ahead of time, in which case 
									they will automatically be assigned sections.
								</p>
								<h3>12/05/2021 Meeting (Online)</h3>
								<div id=agenda02>
									<h3>Agenda:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									This meeting was the first official meeting regarding assignment 3. 
									Although we had discussed a few things, mainly about the artefacts 
									we could complete, earlier on, they were not conducted in proper 
									meetings. The agenda for this meeting was assigning work to each 
									member, going through the specifications and what we as a group 
									expect of each other when completing our assigned sections.
								</p>
								<p>
									When discussing deadlines, it was decided that the first deadline 
									would be at the end of this week. Although we don’t expect a 
									completed section, each member is expected to have at least 
									written down dot points of what they plan to write for all their 
									sections. They are also expected to upload there documents to 
									both the GitHub and the MS Teams Files as proof.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some other topics to discuss was how to improve from the last 
									assignment, such as sticking to deadlines and looking over each 
									other’s work more frequently. Everyone was also to update the 
									ongoing timeframe document, as the timeframe section is to be 
									done individually.
								</p>
								<p>
									Most members were able to attend, however George had already 
									informed us that he would not be able to attend. Although he 
									did not attend, he had already informed the group that 
									he would not be able to attend the meeting and had already 
									messaged the team on which sections he wishes to work on.
								</p>
								<div id=actions02>
									<h3>Actions:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									Each member is to start working on all their sections and 
									show some form of proof that they have been working on it. 
									They will also need to update the ongoing document, so that 
									when the time comes to work on the timeframe section there 
									is no confusion. Each member is also to make sure that 
									they meet the deadlines set during the meeting. To check 
									that deadlines are met, members are to ensure that they update 
									the MS Teams files with their updated work or show some proof 
									in terms of the artefacts.
								</p>
								<h3>18/05/2021 Meeting (Face-to-Face)</h3>
								<div id=agenda03>
									<h3>Agenda:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									This meeting was the second face-to-face meeting where the 
									group focused on assignment 3. In this meeting we ensured 
									that George was caught up with everything that was mentioned 
									in the previous meeting, and also checked that everyone had 
									met the first deadline. The first deadline was for everyone 
									to have posted a document with dot points for each of their 
									sections, detailing what they plan to write. Although this 
									deadline was relatively simple, it was not met by everyone, 
									making it hard to know whether everyone was working on their 
									sections or not. George was exempt from this, as he had 
									missed the previous meeting and was working on the Arduino 
									artefact instead, and had shown proof of his progress.
								</p>
								<p>
									Artem was also missing during this meeting, due to work 
									commitments. This was not an issue as his assigned sections 
									were mostly individual. Victor and Anthony had also 
									discussed on which tool to use to create the mobile app 
									prototype, and had decided to use Figma.
								</p>
								<div id=actions03>
									<h3>Actions:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									Everyone is to ensure that they meet the next deadline, which 
									is to submit a rough draft of their sections by the end of the 
									week, they will be reminded in tomorrow’s meeting. Anthony 
									and Victor will also start working on the mobile app prototype, 
									and should have a rough design by the end of the week. As the 
									first deadline set was not met, it is important that the 
									following one is met and that everyone provide some form of 
									evidence that they did the work they said they would, as this 
									was an issue with the previous assignment.
								</p>
								<h3>19/05/2021 Meeting (Online)</h3>
								<div id=agenda04>
									<h3>Agenda:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									This meeting was our regularly scheduled online meeting, where 
									we mainly focus on catching up on each other’s progress. We 
									start off by going “around”, member to member, and each state 
									what we have been working on, what we plan to do after the 
									meeting until the next meeting, and, most importantly, any 
									issues we encountered when working on the assignment. One 
									other topic was discussing deadlines and whether or not we 
									have met the previous deadline or not.
								</p>
								<p>
									Starting with the first topic on the agenda, each member 
									seemed to be making decent progress on the assignment, 
									with minimal issues. However, the only issue was that 
									some people weren’t posting into the MS Teams files section, 
									to show they’re progress. This is important, as in the 
									previous assignment some members were saying they were done 
									but didn’t post their work until later.
								</p>
								<p>
									Regarding the deadlines topic, it was noted that the team 
									had not met the first agreed deadline. The first deadline, 
									although not as important as the rest, was to post a 
									document of dot points (or drafts) of each of their sections. 
									This both help progress the assignment faster, as well as 
									give each member a chance to do a quick review of each 
									other’s work. As this deadline was not met, it was noted 
									that the next deadline was very important and needed to be 
									met, which was to post a draft of all their sections to the 
									MS Teams and hopefully the GitHub if they have the chance.
								</p>
								<div id=actions04>
									<h3>Actions:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									Everyone was to start writing up drafts of all their assigned 
									sections and post whatever they have done by the next meeting 
									(i.e. the face-to-face meeting on Tuesday). Sahil and George 
									would also need to ensure that they post their progress so 
									far to the MS Teams, so the team can look over them if they 
									have the chance. Everyone also needed to make sure that they 
									meet the next deadline, as it is a very important deadline.
								</p>
								<p>
									A final note, was that everyone would need to come early 
									to the Tuesday class (1:30pm), so that the team can work 
									on the assignment together for a period of time before the 
									scheduled class.
								</p>
								<h3>25/05/2021 Meeting (Face-to-Face)</h3>
								<div id=agenda05>
									<h3>Agenda:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									This meeting is our final face-to-face meeting as it is 
									now week 12 of the semester. The topics on the agenda 
									for this meeting was discussing if we were on track or 
									not, when to put everything together in both the report 
									and the website, and any other issues. An important topic 
									for this meeting was also discussing an unexpected event 
									that occurred in the life of one of our members, and how 
									we should handle it.
								</p>
								<p>
									For the majority of the group, we had completed a draft of 
									each of our assigned sections and would review them in the 
									online meeting. However, part of the group had yet to 
									submit any notable work, which worried the rest of the 
									group about whether or not they would be able to complete 
									the report on time.
								</p>
								<p>
									Artem had unfortunately experienced a tragic event in his 
									family, and the rest of the group decided that we were 
									willing to take over some of his work. As such, we had 
									discussed with our tutor about organising an extension, 
									either for the group or just for Artem, to give Artem some 
									personal time, and to give the group some time to pick 
									up from where Artem had left off.
								</p>
								<p>
									Finally, the majority of the class time would be used 
									to work on the assignment, particularly the mobile app 
									and finishing off the report sections.
								</p>
								<div id=actions05>
									<h3>Actions:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									Everyone was to submit their work to the MS Teams for 
									the rest of the team to review in the next online meeting. 
									It is important that every member (with the exception of Artem) 
									show a substantial amount of work as this would have been 
									the final week to work on the assignment if the group 
									was not granted an extension.
								</p>
								<h3>26/05/2021 Meeting (Online)</h3>
								<div id=agenda06>
									<h3>Agenda:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									This meeting would have been our final regular scheduled 
									online meeting for the assignment (if we weren’t given an 
									extension), so the group treated it as such. We, as a group, 
									looked through each member’s assigned section, reviewing their 
									work and making notes on any changes that could be made to 
									make our work better.
								</p>
								<p>
									Most members had completed their drafts and only needed to 
									make a few minor adjustments, which indicated that they 
									had met the final deadline properly. However, it was noted 
									that Shail had yet to show any substantial work, only showing 
									either dot points or very short paragraphs. As a group, we 
									had make it clear that he would need to pick up the pace and 
									complete it work by our next meeting.
								</p>
								<p>
									The group had also decided to schedule a meeting on Saturday, 
									to hopefully finalise the group work by putting it together 
									into a report and onto the website.
								</p>
								<div id=actions06>
									<h3>Actions:</h3>
								</div>
								<p>
									Everyone should make the edits, which were noted by other 
									members, to our own work and be ready to add them to the 
									report and the website. Sahil would need to complete his 
									sections, and the group would need to look over his work in 
									the following meeting.
								</p>
								<p>
									Artem, had decided that he could still work on some of his 
									assigned sections, but would need some help in the “Plans 
									and Progress” section, which the group has decided that 
									everyone should contribute to.
								</p>
								<p>
									As a group, everyone would also need to think about 
									what to include in the group reflection and be ready 
									to share their thoughts.
