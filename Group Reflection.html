								<h3>What went well?</h3>
								<p>
									I believe that overall our group had worked decently well, of course 
									with any group, there will be certain aspects that need to be improved 
									upon, but there are also aspects that worked well despite that. One 
									of the aspects that I think we did well on was assigning work early 
									on in the assignment. As a group, we had gone through the assignment 
									specifications in our first meeting and distributed the work roughly 
									evenly. Another aspect that I think went reasonably well, was that 
									our group had set deadlines for the group. Assigning deadlines helped 
									with keeping members on track and ensuring that they are held accountable 
									for their own sections. The final aspect that I thin went well in the 
									group was that our group was relatively good at joining the online 
									meeting consistently. Group work is especially difficult if members 
									don’t communicate between each other, and this group seems to communicate 
									rather well.
								</p>
								<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
								<p>
									In my opinion, although overall most members met deadlines on time, 
									there were a few who didn’t or didn’t show evidence that they did 
									through posting their work to either GitHub or MS Teams. This is 
									something I consider to be especially important in group work, 
									especially if one person relies on another’s part. The quality of 
									our work should also be improved and we should have set a standard 
									for members to aim for. Some of our work did not meet our standard 
									and we had only noticed this later on in the assignment which is 
									not ideal.
								</p>
								<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
								<p>
									Something that surprised me was that even though there were two 
									means of posting work the group did not utilise these nearly 
									as much as they should have. By posting our work in our shared 
									drives, the group can see evidence of each members work effort 
									and also to show that members are actually meeting deadlines 
									rather than simply saying they’ve completed the work.
								</p>
								<h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>
								<p>
									Something I had learned about groups is that it is sometimes 
									extremely difficult to find a time for all members to be 
									consistently present. Although our group had found a time where 
									members were generally available, there were a few meetings 
									where we had missing members for both the face-to-face meetings 
									and the online meetings.
								</p>
								<h3>Does our Github log reflect our group work?</h3>
								<p>
									Personally, I think that in terms of number of commits, the 
									GitHub log reflects our groups work, in terms of who was 
									assigned which section. However, in terms of lines committed, 
									they would be skewed towards one member, Victor, as he was 
									the one making the website templates for the group. The reason 
									for this was that we were using his template and it would be 
									easier for him to upload it rather than having everyone 
									recreate it.
