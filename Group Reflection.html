								<h3>Group's Reflection:</h3>
								<p>
									After working on the assignment, the group has come up with 
									some aspects that we, as a group, believe went well. One aspect 
									is that the progress with the prototype went well. We thought 
									this went fairly well considering the limited time we were 
									provided, as well as us trying to incorporate new ideas or 
									improve previous ideas relating to the prototype and the 
									miniature. As we had mad some decent progress, we had unexpectedly 
									has time to improve the miniature and add new features. Another 
									aspect, was that compared to our previous assignment (i.e. 
									Assignment 2), the group was more on track for the most part. 
									This relates to the group discussing the assignment specifications 
									together and in more depth at the beginning of the assignment, 
									which lead to the group having a good start. In terms of designing 
									the report, the process was done slightly better and therefore 
									was more efficient as compared to our last assignment.
								</p>
								<p>
									In terms of what could be improved, the group had agreed 
									that meeting deadlines is something that needs to be improved 
									greatly. Just like the previous assignment, only two to three 
									members had consistently met deadlines, meaning that the assignment 
									work was delayed a lot of the time. Another aspect that could be 
									improved is how the group controls the quality of the assignment. 
									Although we had discussed the standard that the group wished to 
									achieve, we had not reviewed each other’s work until the third 
									week of working on the assignment, as we trusted that each member 
									would meet this standard.
								</p>
								<p>
									What the group found surprising, was that although we had trouble 
									controlling the quality, the work that was completed was of decent 
									quality. The level of depth that the group went into was also 
									improved from the previous assignment and from our initial plan. 
									The group was also surprised that the miniature turned out so well 
									and that we were able to improve our initial idea so well.
								</p>
								<p>
									Something that we learnt about groups is that it is difficult 
									to manage everyone’s time in terms of finding a section of time 
									where all members can meet. The group had occasions where it was 
									difficult scheduling additional meetings, as everyone had different 
									commitments.
								</p>
								<p>
									In terms of our GitHub log, we believe that, excluding assignment 
									2’s log, then the git log would display our group work and 
									distribution very well, once everyone uploads their work to the website.
								</p>
								<h3>Victor's Group Reflection:</h3>
								<p>
									After the discussion we had regarding our Assignment 2 and how we thought we went, we were able to identify what improvements could be made and I have found that we have accomplished most of these. This is in regards to the quality of the work, for the most part, I believe the required standard for the assignment was met by the group’s standard of work. It was great to see as it shows the level of self-discipline and accountability that each member has developed over this project.
								</p>
								<p>
									Contrastingly, room for improvement is still always present as I believe we had a strong start with meeting deadlines but towards the end of this project, the group overall started falling behind by the set deadlines. This could have been due to numerous of reasons such as external events, quality of the work being higher standard or maybe not fully understanding the tasked section but needless to say, improvement in this area still could’ve been made.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the midst of all the chaos, I found that the completion of the both the artefacts, application and miniature, came together really well and was expressed by the quality of it. The concept and depth of this work was truly rewarding by the outcome of the artefacts. This was also reflected by the workload as it seemed that most members had improved their sections as well.
								</p>
								<p>
									Likewise, I found that working as a team can be challenging at times as everyone needs to kept up to date, workloads need to be shared if someone is struggling and the level commitment required needs to be put at the forefront by everyone to be successful. The level of teamwork surprised me again and the way members effortlessly picked up other member’s sections when it was lacking in quality or understanding. This meant overall, the communication between the members was key to the success of our team’s project.
								</p>
								<p>
									The GitHub logs did show a better distribution of each member’s work compared to the last assignment; however, I feel like it does not necessarily present the best reflection of the workload’s contribution and overall, the project. This is because some members helped out others when it was needed and was not reflected in the upload onto GitHub for time constraint and simplicity reasons.
								</p>

								<h3>Anthony's Group Reflection:</h3>
								<p>
									In terms of what went well, I believe that the group had started 
									off well, going through the assignment specifications together, 
									assigning sections, and discussing what we as a group expect of 
									each other. This helped people know what they needed to do, 
									and also reduced the amount of time spent editing work as the 
									work would usually be up to standard. 
								</p>
								<p>
									There were a lot of things that could be improved, one being 
									submitting work on time. This was not in terms of submitting 
									the assignment on time, but each member submitting their work 
									to the shared folder on time, to meet set deadlines. Almost 
									half the members struggled to meet deadlines, making it difficult 
									to stay on track with the report.
								</p>
								<p>
									What surprised me was that the prototyping and the miniature 
									turned out rather well. Initially it seemed like a lot of 
									work in addition to the report, but the group did well in 
									making a lot of progress on the artefacts early on. One other 
									thing that surprised me, was that despite not meeting deadlines 
									in the previous assignment, some members still didn’t meet 
									deadlines and failed to inform the rest of the group.
								</p>
								<p>
									What I learnt about groups is that it is difficult to make 
									sure everyone is on track with the work. This was because 
									this relies on everyone sharing their work, and sharing their 
									struggles. But if people don’t share, it is difficult for the 
									rest of the group to sympathise and help.
								</p>
								<p>
									In my opinion, the git logs should display the group 
									distribution better, as compared to the previous assignment. 
									This is because we have already started off with a base, 
									instead of having one person post the entire base, skewing 
									the results. 
								</p>
								<br>
								<h3>George's Group Reflection:</h3>
								<p>
									I believe that compared to the last assignment, we did a lot better in making sure that we would stick to our deadlines
									and at least have drafts ready at a certain point in time where then we would have plenty of time to look over and edit.
									Starting on our website and report earlier was definitely a good idea as last assignment we left our report to the last
									minute and some of us had to rush to get the finer details done.
								</p>
								<p>
									We did however encounter a terrible issue and that was the fact one of our team members went through a family tragedy
									and that really set us back as they were also struggling with their sections. Fortunately, we were given an extension, but it was still a bit rough with bringing quality up to
									the table for some sections. It was surprising however that we had built quite a decent miniature that looked good and
									worked as intended.
								</p>
								<p>
									We originally thought that we wouldn’t have been able to push out this kind of quality, but I
									believe we did it quite well and were continuously thinking of ways to automate and improve systems.
								</p>
								<p>
									I learned that it
									can be quite tough to have a team member not pushing out their best work because of certain issues as this can take up
									valuable time from other team members if they wished to take up that person’s parts and improve them.

							<h3>Sahil's Group Reflection:</h3>
							<p>The things that went well were that everyone was getting their work done and not only that the artefact went well as we managed to make a protype with function LED and bollards. Also, the prototype design of the app that we made using Figma looked good and functioned the way we wanted it to function. </p>
							<p>The things that could be improved better is having better communications and that everyone meets the groups deadlines on time as we got behind on making the report. </p>
							<p>The thing that was surprising to me was that we managed to get so much done with the 3 weeks we had and how everyone was on top of things not only that I also found it surprising how much work we had done as well, and we didn’t aim for the bare minimum. </p>	
							<p>I learned about groups is that it is hard to get everyone together in one place at a certain time as people have things going on and makes is hard to meet up. Also depending on your group there is less stress involved as you do not have to be the one doing all the work like in high school and that everyone pulls their own weight.</p>
