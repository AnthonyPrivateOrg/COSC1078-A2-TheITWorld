								<h2>Group's Group Reflections</h2>
								<h3>What went well?</h3>
								<p>
									After discussing with the group about what went well, the group 
									thought that discussing the specifications of the assignment and 
									assigning work at the beginning was something that went really 
									well. As each member was assigned their own individual parts, 
									everyone was responsible for their own sections, which helped 
									everyone focus on their own parts. Another aspect that the team 
									thought went well was setting deadlines. These deadlines helped each 
									member stay on track, and in turn would help the team stay on track. 
									These deadlines helped with having all the work done on time rather 
									than leaving everything to the last minute. For the most part, the 
									deadlines were met and everyone was on track for the majority of the time.
									<br><br>In terms of the meetings and what went well with them. The team 
									believed that we were relatively consistent with the meetings, 
									having a scheduled weekly online meeting in addition to the weekly 
									tutorial we should all attend. And since we attended this meeting and 
									most people were present, we never needed to redo meetings or hold a 
									second meeting just to repeat the same content.
								</p>
								<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
								<p>
									The team has agreed that the overall quality of our work has not met 
									our standard, and that for the next assignment we should all work 
									towards provided quality work rather than a large quantity of work. 
									We also think that discussing our ideal standard of work at the 
									beginning of the assignment would have helped this, so that all 
									members know what to aim for. With this assignment, we did not 
									specify a standard early enough, resulting in some parts of the 
									report/website to be lacking and did not meet our expectations
									<br><br>
									Another aspect that could be improved upon was deadlines and meeting 
									deadlines. Regarding making deadlines, the team as unanimously 
									agreed that making the deadlines was a good idea, but they should 
									have been made earlier on. The deadlines we set were only set 
									somewhere near the middle of the assignment rather than the start. 
									This resulted in a slight rush at the end, when we had noticed 
									that some of our worked needed improvement. By setting deadlines 
									earlier we would have more time to review and would be less rushed 
									in completed a high quality report/website. Regarding meeting 
									deadlines, they were mostly met for the first half, however in 
									the second half some of the members most likely overestimated 
									themselves and started to relax too much, missing deadlines. As said 
									before, at the beginning of the assignment, the majority of members 
									were able to meet the deadlines, with some needing a bit more time 
									to refine their sections. However, with the second half, more 
									members were struggling to meet deadlines, this was both due to 
									waiting for another member to finish their part or simply just leaving 
									things to the last minute. Based on this, the members who missed 
									the deadlines should strive to meet them during the next assignment 
									or else there could be more consequences.
								</p>
								<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
								<p>
									The group has agreed that something that was surprising was that our 
									group was slightly ahead on most groups in our tutorial group. Our 
									group had considered ourselves to be either on track or slightly 
									behind. However, we were made aware, during our tutorial session, 
									that our group had in fact done more work than some groups even 
									though it was considered to be not a lot of work.
									<br><br>
									We were also surprised by the fact that our group was relatively 
									good at communicating through MS Teams. We had initially struggle 
									to find a reasonable time to schedule our meetings at the beginning. 
									This was because we were trying to find times where all members 
									would be present for at least half an hour. However, after the 
									first few meetings, we were consistent with our meetings and were 
									mostly on time, with most members present. The only reason for 
									members missing out on a meeting was generally unexpected work 
									commitments, which the team considered to be acceptable.
									<br><br>
									One of the most surprising aspects of the team was the inconsistency 
									in work effort. As said before, initially most members were 
									meeting the set deadlines, both completing the work and posting 
									it in MS Teams. However, after the first deadline, deadlines 
									started to not be met and some of the work submitted was also not 
									up to standard. This was surprising, considering the first deadline 
									was met considerable well, but was suddenly turned around, and the 
									second deadline was not met in the same manner.
								</p>
								<h3>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h3>
								<p>
									In terms of what our team learned about groups, we had learned that 
									it is very difficult to manage teams and times. Everyone had their 
									own commitments, in terms of both work and other courses they were 
									taking. In this sense each individual had a very difficult time 
									managing their own time, and as a whole group we struggled for all 
									members to meet the set deadlines on time. We also learned that, 
									as a group, managing each member’s priorities was very difficult 
									especially when two members worked on the same section.
									<br><br>
									We had also learned that setting deadlines are very important when 
									working in groups/teams. Setting deadlines would help keep members 
									on track and hold them accountable for each of their assigned 
									sections. During this assignment we saw that some members struggled 
									to meet the set deadlines, this could be for multiple reasons, 
									but the deadlines hold them accountable for not completing their 
									sections on time and would indicate to the team who is holding the 
									team back or who needs help.
								</p>
								<h3>Does our Github log reflect our group work?</h3>
								<p>
									Our group believes that in terms of the number of commits, the GitHub 
									log should show an accurate representation on how the work was 
									distributed, how even it was distributed, and how often each 
									member used GitHub. In terms of number of lines committed, the 
									GitHub logs would be more skewed towards Victor, as the group had 
									decided to use his template from assignment 1, and therefore he 
									would have submitted more lines of code for generating the base 
									template. As such, our group believes that the GitHub logs may 
									not be entirely accurate, however, if there are logs for MS Teams, 
									then it would reflect our group work better. The reason for this is 
									because, GitHub lines committed doesn’t includes lines in Word 
									Documents, which is why we believe that number of commits would 
									reflect our group work better than lines committed.
								</p>
								<br><br>
								<h2>Individual Group Reflections</h2>
								<h2>Anthony's Reflection</h2>
								<p>
									I believe that overall our group had worked decently well, of course 
									with any group, there will be certain aspects that need to be improved 
									upon, but there are also aspects that worked well despite that. One 
									of the aspects that I think we did well on was assigning work early 
									on in the assignment. As a group, we had gone through the assignment 
									specifications in our first meeting and distributed the work roughly 
									evenly. Another aspect that I think went reasonably well, was that 
									our group had set deadlines for the group. Assigning deadlines helped 
									with keeping members on track and ensuring that they are held accountable 
									for their own sections. The final aspect that I thin went well in the 
									group was that our group was relatively good at joining the online 
									meeting consistently. Group work is especially difficult if members 
									don’t communicate between each other, and this group seems to communicate 
									rather well.<br><br>
									In my opinion, although overall most members met deadlines on time, 
									there were a few who didn’t or didn’t show evidence that they did 
									through posting their work to either GitHub or MS Teams. This is 
									something I consider to be especially important in group work, 
									especially if one person relies on another’s part. The quality of 
									our work should also be improved and we should have set a standard 
									for members to aim for. Some of our work did not meet our standard 
									and we had only noticed this later on in the assignment which is 
									not ideal.<br><br>
									Something that surprised me was that even though there were two 
									means of posting work the group did not utilise these nearly 
									as much as they should have. By posting our work in our shared 
									drives, the group can see evidence of each members work effort 
									and also to show that members are actually meeting deadlines 
									rather than simply saying they’ve completed the work.
									Something I had learned about groups is that it is sometimes 
									extremely difficult to find a time for all members to be 
									consistently present. Although our group had found a time where 
									members were generally available, there were a few meetings 
									where we had missing members for both the face-to-face meetings 
									and the online meetings.<br><br>
									Personally, I think that in terms of number of commits, the 
									GitHub log reflects our groups work, in terms of who was 
									assigned which section. However, in terms of lines committed, 
									they would be skewed towards one member, Victor, as he was 
									the one making the website templates for the group. The reason 
									for this was that we were using his template and it would be 
									easier for him to upload it rather than having everyone 
									recreate it.
								</p>
								<h2>Artem's Reflection</h2>
								<p>
									I believe we did quite well as a group. There are certainly things 
									that need to be improved, but I don’t think there could ever be 
									a group that wouldn’t need any sort of improvement. The aspect, 
									that I reckon, we went really well at was establishing a 
									timeline of deadlines and distributing the work.
									<br><br>
									Meeting said deadlines is probably one of the things we could 
									improve, however, we set them up with room for error and time 
									for polishing up our work, so I reckon we stayed on track relatively 
									well. Another thing that could be improved is establishing a 
									common format of our work, so that we wouldn’t have to change 
									things around in the end to keep the work consistent.
									<br><br>
									At the moment, it’s hard to properly collaborate as, a lot of the 
									times, our timetables don’t match up. So splitting up the work 
									evenly, working on it independently, asking for help and 
									assisting each other, in my opinion, was the right way to go. 
									A timeline helped us stay on track and allowed us, to my surprise, 
									to not fall too much behind. Personally, being just out of high 
									school, I found that my teachers pushing me to do work actually 
									helped me. Now that no one actually cares whether I do my work 
									or not and I have to organise myself on my own, deadlines really 
									did help a lot. I will definitely take note of that for my future 
									projects.
									<br><br>
									I’ve also learnt that, in groups, a leadership role is important. 
									In our group that role was fulfilled by Anthony and I am very 
									thankful to him for that. He made sure we are staying on track, 
									provided help where we needed and kept the workflow moving. He 
									motivated and pushed me, which I believe is another big reason 
									as to why we never fell back too far behind.      
								</p>
								<h2>George's Reflection</h2>
								<p>
									I believe that assigning sections to each group member at the 
									beginning of the assignment was a very good idea as there ended 
									up being no confusion as to what tasks each person had to do and 
									overall increased efficiency. The fact that we all pretty much got 
									our first section done (out of 2) early on so we could start our 
									second one as soon as possible. We could have however improved 
									our use of time for our second section. Most of us I believe got 
									a bit complacent and believed they could easily get their second 
									section done. I think we could have also taken a look at each 
									other’s assignment 1 work in order to assist the people that had 
									a hard time completing their assignment and therefore had a hard 
									time putting in the quality and quantity into assignment 2. What 
									was surprising though was the level of communication we had in 
									this group compared to my other groups. We all made sure to meet 
									up on every planned meeting and we clearly discussed what we had 
									to do and what we had accomplished. What I have learned from 
									groups was that it was hard to manage/make sure that people had 
									done their parts to a satisfactory degree and that wasted 
									valuable time trying to catch up with those things. But besides 
									that I believe that groups are useful in the sense that group 
									members can provide you with assistance in order to complete 
									your work.
