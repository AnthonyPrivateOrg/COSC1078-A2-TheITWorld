								<p>My name is Anthony Nguyen. I was born in Australia with a Vietnamese background, as both parents are Vietnamese. English is my first language, and with my Vietnamese background, I know a bit of Vietnamese. My interest in IT started in highschool when I took a game development class, although I ended up not being too interest in developing games, I started to get into other aspects of IT starting from there. My interest in It was mainly in the areas of software development, which lead me to choosing a Computer Science degree. As I am a third year, I have learned a few programming languages such as Java, C, C++, and Python. I also have some experience using SQL, and using SpringBoot and Python Flask to develop basic web apps. Some of my hobbies include cooking, playing computer and sometimes mobile games, and occasionally gardening.

									<p>My name is George Stergiadis. I was born in Australia and currently live in Melbourne. I have completed secondary school at Wellington Secondary College, and I am now in my first year of Information Technology at RMIT. I understand both Arabic and Greek to a certain degree other than English and mostly understand Arabic rather than speak it compared to Greek. I used to learn Greek at a school on Saturdays. In my spare time I enjoy gaming on my computer and from time to time have streamed on Twitch. I enjoy talking to the people I have met through the internet while streaming. Before I even started school, I knew how to use a computer through watching my father work on accounting and other work-related things. Since then, I’ve been interested in computers and IT and enjoy troubleshooting issues people may have with their computers. I personally have limited knowledge in programming and other software-based endeavours. I have done the bare basics in HTML programming in high school. I have messed around with the R programming language but to a small degree and have no knowledge of it now. I have also done basic database management with MS Access.

										<p>Hi! My name is Artem! . I was born in Russia and moved to Australia almost 9 years ago. , I managed to find a job in the midst of the first lockdown at a computer repair store. Getting this job allowed me to save up and move out from my mum’s house this year. So now I live by myself, that is if you don’t count my grumpy roommate. I’ve been interested in IT for as long as I remember. Both of my parents work in the IT industry, so I’m guessing, it carried over in DNA, and maybe growing up in such an environment played its role. What keeps me interested now is the prospect of technology in the future, how it can help humanity grow as a whole, as long as we don’t use it to wipe each other out from the face of the Earth, which becomes more and more realistic each day. I chose to study at RMIT because, from what I’ve heard, RMIT is good at teaching from the very basics of the course. That appealed to me as there are some aspects of this course that I don’t have that much background information about, such as working with databases. I believe everything I’m taught is useful, so I expect to learn everything this course throws at me: SQL, Python, even Chinese if need be… I’ll do my best to learn it all.

											<p>This is my first year at RMIT, but I have studied the same course at Monash University back in 2019.
												After the whole COVID break, thought it was time for a switch and applied for here!

												<p>I was born in India and came to Australia when I was 2 years old, I speak both Hindi and Punjabi at home with my parents. I went to Albion North Primary School from Prep to Grade 4 until I had to move houses and change primary schools to Deer Park West primary school which I studied at from Grade 5 to Grade 6. The high school that I went to was Caroline Chisholm Catholic College which I graduated in 2020. I enjoy reading manga, watching anime, and chilling in my spare time. My Interest in IT began when I was in high school when I discovered that there is technology everywhere around us. I realised that Technology is something that is just not only something we touch but invisible as well such as the cloud and the Wi-Fi. I used to think that the Wi-Fi is something that was provided from a little box but the more I learned about it the more fascinated I got the more I learned.

								<p>Based on the test results, we have a few common traits. Some of us are more introverted <br> than others, however everyone can work well in a group environment. In general, we all <br> seem like a good bunch of people: friendly and not self-centred. A lot of our traits match <br> in the Myers-Briggs Test, so it looks like we will get along as a group. Some of us do have <br> difficulties doing large portions of work, can get distracted and lose focus, so supporting <br> each other within our group and providing help will definitely help us to work as efficiently as <br> we can. But we also shouldn’t forget that we all have our own ways of working and learning <br> and should always keep that in mind. It seems like it would be best for us to distribute the work <br> evenly amongst ourselves and work on our portions of work independently, checking over with <br> each other during our meetings and providing feedback.</p>
