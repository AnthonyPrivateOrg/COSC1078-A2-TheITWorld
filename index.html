								<p>
									My name is Anthony Nguyen. I was born in Australia with a Vietnamese background, as both parents are Vietnamese. English is my first language, and with my Vietnamese background, I know a bit of Vietnamese. My interest in IT started in high school when I took a game development class, although I ended up not being too interested in developing games, I started to get into other aspects of IT starting from there.

										My name is George Stergiadis, and my student ID is s3895662. I was born in Australia and currently live in Melbourne. I have completed secondary school at Wellington Secondary College, and I am now in my first year of Information Technology at RMIT. I understand both Arabic and Greek to a certain degree other than English and mostly understand Arabic rather than speak it compared to Greek. I’ve been interested in computers and IT and enjoy troubleshooting issues people may have with their computers.

											Hi! My name is Artem! I was born in Russia and moved to Australia almost 9 years ago. I managed to find a job in the midst of the first lockdown at a computer repair store. Getting this job allowed me to save up and move out from my mum’s house this year. So now I live by myself, that is if you don’t count my grumpy roommate. I’ve been interested in IT for as long as I remember. Both of my parents work in the IT industry, so I’m guessing, it carried over in DNA, and maybe growing up in such an environment played its role. What keeps me interested now is the prospect of technology in the future, how it can help humanity grow as a whole, as long as we don’t use it to wipe each other out from the face of the Earth, which becomes more and more realistic each day.

												Hey there, my name is Victor Heather and a student at RMIT studying a Bachelor of IT. Residing in Melbourne currently, I was born in Sydney and lived in Brisbane as well. Likewise, my parents both are from overseas, giving me a huge cultural background of Filipino, Spanish, American, New Zealander and Cook Islander but can’t really speak much of the national languages! Definitely a cultured person! IT has been a big passion of mine ever since high school, focusing and enjoying a lot on both the design and programming side of IT.

												<p>
													My Name is Sahil Mann. I was born in India and moved to Australia when I was 1 years old, mostly at I home I speak Hindi. My interest of IT started when I did web programming in high school, and I got easy marks. I went to Caroline Chisholm Catholic College and decided to go to RMIT due to the number of reviews I got and how close it is to the station.

								<h2>Group Processes</h2>
								<p>
									The group overall did quite decent. The group thought that discussing the specifications
									of the assignment and assigning work at the beginning was something that went really well.
									As each member was assigned their own individual parts, everyone was responsible for
									their own sections, which helped everyone focus on their own parts. Setting deadlines
									also helped the team to stay on track most of the time. This strategy would help make
									sure work was done on time instead of at the last minute. We were also relatively
									consistent with team meetings as well with the odd missing person here and there. 
								</p>

								<p>
									In assignment 3 it might be best to improve the quality of work compared to the previous assignment as it didn’t meet
									our expectations. Discussing our ideal standard of work at the beginning of the assignment would help with this, so that
									all members know what to aim for. The deadlines made in the previous assignment were met in the first half however
									people began to slack off so making sure we don’t overestimate this assignment will help towards this. The deadlines
									should also be set at the beginning so in the case of issues with work we will most likely have more time to review and
									edit work. Overall, following through with everything and making sure our processes are smooth will lessen stress in
									parts of this assignment if there are troubles.
								</p>

								<h2>Career Plans</h2>
								<p>
									Overall, our career plans and jobs are all similar in the sense that they are all very technical positions that require
									expertise in each field. Most of our ideal jobs are more focused on the backend of things whereas Victor’s ideal job
									would be mostly working on the frontend of interfaces and pretty much UX in general as his position is of a UX Designer
									and this job mainly entails a connection between both user and product and the overall design stage. So, what can also
									be said about Victor’s career is that it is vastly different than the other team members’ careers as the others are
									focused mainly on software operations and dealing with technical problem solving.
								</p>

								<p>
									It is believed that Sahil’s and George’s careers may be similar in the sense that solutions will need to be implemented
									for the betterment of other people and businesses. Sahil’s career is based on cybersecurity as a possible cybersecurity
									specialist. Mainly concentrating on the potential attacks that businesses may come up against and his duty would be to
									devise solutions to stop such a thing from happening. Similarly, George’s career is based on analysing systems and also
									determining what needs to be done to current IT systems to make them more efficient and to provide support if problems
									may arise.
