								<h3>Testing</h3>
								<p>
									Testing will be a crucial task to ensure our project and more specifically, our artefacts, work to the intended level. Through trial and error and many iterations of the design, Pie9 will be able to see what problems we encounter and the potential problems that could arise. From this, we will then be able to adjust our artefacts to account for these and optimise to the best of our ability.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our application is made using Figma, presenting us with the opportunity to make different design iterations and functionality implementations. This will be key to really flesh out our artefact 1 as it will be half of the proposed system. To ensure the application is usable for users, testing methods can be introduced to carry this out. 
								</p>
								<p>
									A suitable method for testing our application, given the current circumstances and situation, would be remote user testing. This would entail us to recruit users to test our prototype and by extension, our functional application in the future, to ensure that the main tasks we want the user to be able to perform, booking and viewing bookings, is a simple and reliable. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The remote testing method specifically could be done via web services user testing. Essentially, we will recruit participants, possible through the website/service <a href="http://www.usertesting.com/"> http://www.usertesting.com </a> , which will then allow us to specify the tasks we want these users to attempt but also, allow us to specify the type and number of users we want. For this application, we would need users from Victoria as our application is centred around this state (currently). It would be most beneficial as well to recruit users who are drivers as they would be the ones using our application and would the targeted audience. Regarding the number of users, this would vary for both the prototype and actual application. For the prototype, a user testing size of around 30 participants would be satisfactory as we will need initial feedback to implement into our prototype. On the contrary, the actual application would require a much larger user testing size to ensure we account for all angles in our design.
								</p>
								<p>
									The miniature and Arduino sensory system that we have created could also present potential issues. The hardware components of our system would need be tested extensively as well to ensure we are not using any faulty components. For example, the photoresistor will need to be adjusted due to light levels, as the miniature does allow for light to enter but we have tried to balance this by having a torch above (acting as a constant light source like an overhead light in a carpark). 
								</p>
								<p>
									To test however, trial and error would need to be done as if this was to be implemented, the light levels would be different in each area due to factors such as above exposure, surrounding lights, general surroundings and more.
								</p>
								<p>
									For our future system, further testing would be required as well. Problems regarding the connection between the application and sensory system will present a big challenge for us as ensuring the communication is satisfactory will be key to our system being successful. Hence, ensuring the location for our system is implemented in the correct areas as we would need to make certain that the connection established between the app, system and potential database is not hindered by any interference. This may be to having our system in an underground parking area. Likewise, making sure the user has a stable connection to the internet to be able to send signals to the system that they have arrived to deactivate the bollard at their bay. 
								</p>
								<p>
									These would all be considered down the track but to compensate and reduce these potential issues, testing and research would need to be done. The system would be best tested in a few spots first, just like our miniature representation, and by extension, would need to be testing in different areas/situations (for example, different light levels, carpark levels, underground parking, and more).
								</p>
								<p>
									As this is a huge project to undertake, testing will need to be done at every stage as well as constant brainstorm and communication between the members of the gorup. More and more resources will need to be invested for this project to be successful and to rule out any ‘dead ends’ or situations that will detriment our progress, having quick and simple mock-ups to gather feedback will be essential. The system will evolve overtime and once users are presented with an easy, reliable, efficient and effective booking system, this is when Pie9 knows they have accomplished their goal. We want users to reap the benefits of not struggling to find parking anymore, not give them another burden. Hence, testing our system will be a high priority for us.
