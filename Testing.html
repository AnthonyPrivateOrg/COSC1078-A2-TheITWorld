								<h3>Testing</h3>
								<p>The way we will test our project is using trial and error to see what problems we run into and attempt to fix them. The App is made using Figma, so we can have a general idea of the design and how it will function before we turn into an app in the future. Some other problems that we could run into are such as our Arduino sensor not being able to detect the prototype car due to the size. We could resolve this by testing different types of shapes and sizes. We might need to keep changing the light levels, of different areas as most places might need different programming compared to other areas as there are different places where carparks can be made. We need will need to test the app to make sure it doesn’t run in to any connection problems such underground parking areas or connections such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi if we decide that’s how we want to connect our app to the carpark and Arduino.</p>
								<p>For our prototype we needed to use a lot of trial and error as with the miniature carpark we need to keep changing the levels of light that the Arduino can detect. So that the LED light can shine brighter.  We need basically trial and error our whole project as at the moment we might in the future change how it looks to make it more efficient or change the tools we use as when implementing into the real world we might need something bigger and different tools. But we will try to use trial and error as least as we can as we don’t want to be spending too much money on a project like this and instead making it work and implementing it into carparks or make carparks out of our design. </p>
								<p>The app is made using Figma so that we could make a prototype before we can make it into the real thing. As we don’t want to start making an app without a plan first and general design idea. Not only that it would make the process of making the app go smoother. We wouldn’t want to start making the app and spending money on it and realising its not what we wanted. Figma allows us to keep changing our design without any cost and keep testing to see how our app will work and what works well together. Such as the colours and how everything links up together without it being a hassle to us and the user.</p>
								<p>There are many different types of cars out there and if we were to implement this into the real world, we would need to make sure it can detect every single car. Since not all cars are made in the same shape or size. At the moment we are using a carboard cut out to represent our car but in the we would need to run test runs with different cars to make sure that the carpark in sufficient. This will make sure that in the future it doesn’t run into any problems. With the prototype we can make different shapes of cars and different sizes to see how it will impact the result and if it will change anything.</p>
								<p>The light levels that the Arduino detect needs to be keep being changed as sometimes it might not detect at all or might be able to detect to well and might be able to detect other light sources such as sunlight or moon light or maybe even car headlights and we wouldn’t want that to happen. Trial and error is the best way to test this or maybe having someone with more experience look at our prototype and give us their insight. On our we could improve it and make it be able to detect the cars better and be able to send signal to the users' phone at a faster rate.</p>
